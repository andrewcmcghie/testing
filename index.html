          <h5 class="card-title">Rick Ross</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Ross was born William Leonard Roberts II in Coahoma County, Mississippi, on January 28, 1976. Raised in Carol City, Florida — an impoverished area of north of Miami — Ross gravitated to the music of street-oriented rappers like Tupac Shakur, Notorious B.I.G., Luther Campbell and Ice Cube. Although he attended Georgia's Albany State University on a football scholarship for a year, Ross started writing rap lyrics that romanticized drug dealing, an act that he saw as a child.
            He took his performing name from stories he heard of a drug trafficker named "Freeway" Rick Ross. Ironically, Ross worked as a corrections officer in Florida for almost two years (something he initially denied when it was revealed, but later accepted), but the lure of hip-hop music and the lavish lifestyle of the drug dealers he saw throughout his youth led him in another direction..</p>
